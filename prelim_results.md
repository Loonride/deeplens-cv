n_frames = 9183  
time: 403.08s  
Avg. CPU Usage: 57%  

**Experiment 3**  
buffer_size = 1000  
n_frames = 9183  
time: 417.36s  
Avg. CPU Usage: 60%  

**Experiment 4**  
buffer_size = auto  
n_frames = 9183

Avg. CPU Usage: 62%  


## 6 python scripts simultaneously, 10 video chunks of 30s each  
**Experiment 4**  
Splitting the video costs ~600s (nearly at 1x speed)  
buffer_size = 800  
n_frames = 9000 in total, 900 each  
time: ~370s  
Avg CPU Usage: 91%  

**Experiment 5**  
6 python scripts simultaneously, 10 video chunks of 30s each  
buffer_size = 1000 (>900)  
n_frames = 9000 in total, 900 each  
time: ~390s  
Avg. CPU Usage: 90%  

**Experiment 6**  
6 python scripts simultaneously, 10 video chunks of 30s each  
buffer_size = 300  
n_frames = 9000 in total, 900 each  
time: ~320s  
Avg. CPU Usage: 95%  

**Experiment 7**  
6 python scripts simultaneously, 10 video chunks of 30s each  
buffer_size = 100  
n_frames = 9000 in total, 900 each  
time: ~330s  
Avg. CPU Usage: 87% (last 4 chunks doesn't fully utilize 6-core CPU)
